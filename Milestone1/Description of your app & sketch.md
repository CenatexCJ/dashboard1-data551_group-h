## Description of your app & sketch

The app contains a U.S. map that shows all the states. The map is interactive and users can click on a state to show the information for that state. Below the map is a filter menu which can be used to adjust which schools will be displayed according to several selecting criteria (school type, degree length, state, in/out state, whether it has room & board and tuition range). A list of all the schools that meet the selecting criteria will be displayed in the top-right box, showing the detailed cost for that school. Below the school list are two bar chart, comparing the selected school's tuition and the projected salary potential with the state average and nation average.
