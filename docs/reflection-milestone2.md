## Reflection

Our group in the past week started working on the dahsboard app after getting go ahead on our sketch design. We divided the work based on different components and gave some timeline to finish it post which we synced for merging of the components and eventually hosting it on heroku. The division of work as follows:

Navdeep -  Heatmap and the dropdown
Bowen - School List
Can - Filters Dropdowns, Tuition Range and Bar charts

Below is the functionality of each components:

- Heatmap - It shows the US geographical map based on 4 factors - Instate Tuition Fees, Outstate Tuition Fees, Early Career Pay, Mid Career Pay and we can control this via dropdown

- Filters Dropdown - We had some columns like school type (private or public), year of program, state which were filtered through dropdown based on which we get list of different schools

- Tuition Range - Its is the slider to filter the tuition fees based on which we can get list of different schools

- School List - Based on the filters and tuition range selected, we get the list of schools along with other important info related to each school, and we can select particular school to compare it in the bar chart plots.

- Bar Charts - It compares the school fees with the national and the state average and also the salaries post graduation with the national and state average

Based on the above plan we started working on individual components on the VS code via python and the associated libraries. Based on the sketch which we proposed, we made some plan to include the functionalities and the components in this milestone and then we have also made the plan to improve on our app in milestone4. After completing our individual components and its associated functionalities, we then merged all the components over a zoom call, it was the complete smooth pricess and the next target was to deploy it over the heroku server. We were able to deploy it on heroku both the common repo and our inidividual repositories.

## Milestone 4 Scope and Plan

Below is the list of items that we are taking to the scope of milestone4 so that its easy for us to refer this file and work accordingly:

- Numbers on Bar chart - We need to show numbers on the bar chart as well
- Improve the bar chart plots - We need to interchange x and y labels. Also we need to improve the x axis labels
- Include Instate/Outstate toggle button to switch between the instate/outstate tuition bar plots
- Map to highlight the state which is selected - This needs to be done if it is feasible to do, need to reasearch upon this

Note: - Will add more things in case in case of more brainstorming and feedback from TA in Milestone2
