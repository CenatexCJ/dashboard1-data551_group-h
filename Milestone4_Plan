Below is the list of items that we are taking to the scope of milestone4 so that its easy for us to refer this file and work accordingly:

- Slider - Currently on changing the slider range values, list of universities are not updating, need to fix it
- Numbers on Bar chart - We need to show numbers on the bar chart as well
- Improve the second bar chart -  currently the second bar chart is not in the correct state, need to change it to salary and make sure that it is also linked with the select button as same as the first bar chart.
Also we need to improve the x axis labels
- Remove Instate, Outstate, room and board and no board
- Map to highlight the state which is selected - This needs to be done if it is feasible to do, need to reasearch upon this
- On clicking District of Columbia, getting error, maybe because of no data, needs to be removed from the state list in the code

Will add more things in case in case of more brainstorming
