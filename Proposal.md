### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose


> Our role: Data scientist educational advisory firm
>
> Target audience: US Educational Advisory Management
>
> In United States, we have lot of parents who are worried about the future prospects of their children especially after high school or undergrad in terms of university selection to pursue higher studies. But for them it is very difficult to decide which institutions to prefer because of lesser knowledge and complex factors involved. As a result, they eventually take the services of a very famous Educational Advisory firm situated in New York which helps them in selecting institutions/universities based on various factors like tuition fees, region, salary after graduation, type etc. The firm has hired us as a Data Scientists of team of three to come up with an overall visualizations and Dashboard providing some quality Analysis/patterns based on which they can provide some useful and quality suggestions for their clients.
